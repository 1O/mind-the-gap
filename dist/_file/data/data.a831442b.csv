However, past planning decisions, the absence of hazard maps in the past, and changing frequencies and magnitudes of hazard events have created situations where considerable amounts of zoned building land, existing buildings and infrastructure are located in areas exposed to risk. Due to climate-driven expansion of many hazard zones, the volume of exposed building land and objects is bound to grow further. The options for spatial planning to intervene with adaptation and risk reduction measures in already existing zonings and building structures are limited, because it would affect valid rights of property owners and property values. Provisions for dealing in a preventive way with risk-exposed stocks of buildings and zoned, but yet undeveloped building land are still largely missing. There is a need for addressing this gap in spatial planning legislation and instruments, in particular as regards building laws, and for providing guidelines for how to mitigate risks to existing settlement areas."

This, in turn, can negatively affect the local responsiveness and responsibility, and slow down the intervention. Lacking knowledge of the civil protection plan can aggravate this issue, while a contact center point or a strengthened regional information center would help to improve the situation."
