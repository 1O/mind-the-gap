The persistent growth dynamics of settlement areas vis-a-vis intensifying hazard processes and expanding hazard zones due to climate change result in constantly growing climate risks. Substantial reduction of further land consumption, soil sealing and urban sprawl is needed to contain further increase in risk exposure, but so far spatial planning policies and instruments have been limited in effectiveness, due to lack of adequate regulations, enforceability or coherent implementation. Spatial planning systems (legislation, planning instruments, fiscal and subsidy policies, planning processes and practices at all levels) need to be re-directed towards forcing compact, inward-oriented, land-efficient and soil-saving settlement development with adequate (re-)densification of built-up areas ('land sufficiency'), while steering current and future hazard zones free from development and securing green spaces and their nature-based hazard protection and adaptation functions.",1,Prevention: non-structural,"Policy design & planning

NH,Financing and insurance,"Insurance systems, in particular such based on the private insurance market, are increasingly under pressure due to rising flood risk. According to projections, several European regions could face an adaptation tipping point in the long run beyond which the uptake of flood insurance will be too low for a viable system. Limits to the viability of (market-based) insurance systems can result from constraints to premium ratings and from constraints on maximizing coverage:
• Due to climate change and the urbanization of floodplains, insurers are already experiencing or anticipating increasing risk and will be forced to raise their premium ratings. Higher premiums may cause increased unaffordability for low-income groups and an overall decreased demand, decreasing the financial viability of insurance programs. For some insurers, market conditions have already become unattractive because their climate risk exposure has risen and their consumers are unwilling or unable to pay higher premiums. 
• Related to unaffordibility is a partly too low insurance market penetration, i.e. a too small percentage of policy holders in the total population of exposed households. For example, the market penetration in Europe varies across different insurance systems in Europe from up to 100% in the mandatory system in France to very low penetration rates of 10-25% in the voluntary private insurance system in Austria. A flood insurance scheme with a market penetration of <25% is regarded as economically unviable.

NH,Structural protection measures,"Managed retreat and relocation should be considered as an alternative risk management option in situations where path dependencies could lead to lock-in effects, especially in high-risk areas with returning damage events, limited feasibility of technical protection, and/or high probability that technical protection limits may be reached under conditions of progressing climate change. Continued upgrading of protection infrastructures to maintain tolerable risk levels vis-a-vis climate change-induced increases in flood hazards requires constantly growing and accumulating public investments, can cause maladaptive path dependencies and growth in residual risk exposure, and thus vulnerability lock-ins. At the same time, the protective effects are always limited to defined design events (e.g. a 100-year annual probability of flood ocurrence), even when the same (e.g. 100-year) protection level is maintained through regular retrofitting. Due to excessive cost and/or future changes in extreme events, situations may occur where upgrading of protection structures reaches technical and/or economic limits, risk levels become intolerable, and substantial damage and loss inevitable in the long run. In such cases, managed retreat or relocation from exposed areas becomes the risk management option with a significantly more favourable cost-benefit ratio, compared to incremental retrofitting of protection infastructures, which offer short-term benefits, but may cause long-term lock-ins in exposure and risk, resulting in unexpectedly high damage when protection limits are reached.",0,"Prevention: structural

NH,Structural protection measures,"Structural protection measures may shift vulnerability and risk to other places and other people. Such maladaptive effects can occur especially if one-sided localized approaches to the planning of protection systems prevail. For example, structural river engineering can accelerate and amplify flood waves and increase flood risk in downstream river sections. Similarly, object-related protection measures against flooding and heavy rainfall, e.g. by geo-engineering terrain features or through technical safety constructions on properties, can increase vulnerability to flooding of neighboring properties at local scale or, through summation effects, of entire drainage areas and downstream residents. Planning protection systems at regional scale, rather than focusing on individual structures at local scale, is more likely to avoid unintended re-distribution of vulnerability and risk to other places. Applying ex-ante assessments of unintended side effects and setting up cross-sectoral, multi-level coordination mechanisms for protective measures can be helpful in that regard.",0,Prevention: structural,"Effectiveness & efficiency

NH,Structural protection measures,"Structural protection measures, such as river regulations, artificial water retention reservoirs or torrential control measures, often involve trade-offs and potential conflicts with environmental sustainability and may cause negative external effects on ecosystems, natural resources, and biodiversity. Examples include degradations of river and floodplain ecosystems and of their ecosystem services, including for nature-based adaptation and risk reduction functions. Giving preference to alternative risk management options, such as nature-based solutions (e.g. securing and restoring natural flood retention and runoff areas) or non-structural prevention measures (e.g. preventive spatial planning aimed at containing risk exposure), whereever possible, can prevent such maladaptive outcomes.",0,"Prevention: structural

NH,Structural protection measures,"Structural protection measures may involve trade-offs and conflicts with goals of social justice and equity, e.g. by creating unequitable social distribution effects. Driven by cost-benefit considerations, investments in flood adaptation to sustain tolerable risk are most common in densely populated, urbanised and economically well-developed areas with substantial assets. The high cost of flood protection and other technical adaptation options (e.g., elevating buildings) often forestalls action in sparsely populated regions, with rural and economically disadvantaged areas typically exhibiting lower levels of structural adaptation.  If adaptation investments in wealthy communities are prioritised, while poorer and vulnerable communities are left without comparable levels of flood protection, this tends to entrench existing social and spatial inequalities and raises questions about the fairness of public resource allocation.",0,Prevention: structural,"Policy design & planning

NH,Structural protection measures,"The presence of technical protection measures can trigger and sustain unrealistically high trust in public flood protection measures, especially if combined with lack of awareness about residual risk and reliance on social support in disaster situations. This can create false feelings of security, foster problem-avoiding behaviour and undermine the willingness of private actors (households, property owners) to take individual risk precaution measures.  In part, investing heavily in protection infrastructure can inhibit autonomous adaptation action, increase dependency on public risk reduction measures, and create perverse incentives for people to settle in areas that are only temporarily safe (e.g. flood embankments) or to remain in places and continue with activities that make them vulnerable in the case of a residual risk event happening. Counteracting these unintended effects requires clear communication of protection standards, safety levels, residual risk, and the limited effects of protection systems, in order to foster risk awareness, incentivise individual risk precaution measures and improve compliance with public risk reduction measures.",0,"Prevention: structural

NH,Structural protection measures,"Through interaction with spatial development, flood and natural hazard protection infrastructures can induce maladaptive development trajectories that are difficult or impossible to reverse, correct or retract. Implementation of protection measures often incentivizes 'business-as-usual' development and can trigger development intensification with new construction activities, expansion of settlement areas and in-migration of residents on supposedly ‘protected’ land. In conjunction with increasing flood hazards due to climate change, this consisteantly increases exposure to (growing) residual risk, vulnerability, and severity of consequences in case of overload or technical failure (‘safe development paradox’). Especially when climate-related risks increase at a faster rate than upgrades to existing protective infrastructure, this can result in excessive damage and loss when adaptation limits are exceeded. The reliance on structural protection measures with their associated high, returning and accumulating costs can create path dependencies with self-reinforcing dynamics, by tieing up capital and by shaping the legal, administrative and mental framework conditions, thus reducing the solution space over time.",0,Prevention: structural,"Policy design & planning
