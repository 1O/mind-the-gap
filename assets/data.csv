The options for spatial planning to intervene with adaptation and risk reduction measures in already existing zonings and building structures are limited, because it would affect valid rights of property owners and property values. Provisions for dealing in a preventive way with risk-exposed stocks of buildings and zoned, but yet undeveloped building land are still largely missing.
