nh_19,"Insurance systems, in particular such based on the private insurance market, are increasingly under pressure due to rising flood risk. According to projections, several european regions could face an adaptation tipping point in the long run beyond which the uptake of flood insurance will be too low for a viable system. Limits to the viability of (market-based) insurance systems can result from constraints to premium ratings and from constraints on maximizing coverage: • due to climate change and the urbanization of floodplains, insurers are already experiencing or anticipating increasing risk and will be forced to raise their premium ratings. Higher premiums may cause increased unaffordability for low-income groups and an overall decreased demand, decreasing the financial viability of insurance programs. For some insurers, market conditions have already become unattractive because their climate risk exposure has risen and their consumers are unwilling or unable to pay higher premiums. • Related to unaffordibility is a partly too low insurance market penetration, i. E. A too small percentage of policy holders in the total population of exposed households. For example, the market penetration in europe varies across different insurance systems in europe from up to 100% in the mandatory system in france to very low penetration rates of 10-25% in the voluntary private insurance system in austria. A flood insurance scheme with a market penetration of <25% is regarded as economically unviable.
