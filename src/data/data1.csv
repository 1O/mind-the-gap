Simultaneously, by steering green and open spaces clear of development, their nature-based adaptation services against natural hazards and drought can be conserved and valorized, including water retention, rainwater infiltration, groundwater renewal, and decentralized rainwater management. Spatial planning needs a shift in perspective from planning the development of the built environment to 'positive planning' of green and open spaces on equal footing. This includes: giving more importance to the multiple functions and co-benefits of undeveloped green spaces for society and environment in the context of climate change; developing differentiated instruments for the planning and development of green spaces; upgrading the weight of nature- and landscape-related aspects in existing spatial planning instruments.",0,Prevention: structural,structural,policy design & planning,"multi-hazard, multi-risk",national & subnational
