However, past planning decisions, the absence of hazard maps in the past, and changing frequencies and magnitudes of hazard events have created situations where considerable amounts of zoned building land, existing buildings and infrastructure are located in areas exposed to risk. Due to climate-driven expansion of many hazard zones, the volume of exposed building land and objects is bound to grow further. The options for spatial planning to intervene with adaptation and risk reduction measures in already existing zonings and building structures are limited, because it would affect valid rights of property owners and property values. Provisions for dealing in a preventive way with risk-exposed stocks of buildings and zoned, but yet undeveloped building land are still largely missing. There is a need for addressing this gap in spatial planning legislation and instruments, in particular as regards building laws, and for providing guidelines for how to mitigate risks to existing settlement areas.",1,Prevention: non-structural,non-structural,policy design & planning,"multi-hazard, multi-risk",national & subnational

772,nh_19,natural hazard management,financing and insurance,"Insurance systems, in particular such based on the private insurance market, are increasingly under pressure due to rising flood risk. According to projections, several european regions could face an adaptation tipping point in the long run beyond which the uptake of flood insurance will be too low for a viable system. Limits to the viability of (market-based) insurance systems can result from constraints to premium ratings and from constraints on maximizing coverage: • due to climate change and the urbanization of floodplains, insurers are already experiencing or anticipating increasing risk and will be forced to raise their premium ratings. Higher premiums may cause increased unaffordability for low-income groups and an overall decreased demand, decreasing the financial viability of insurance programs. For some insurers, market conditions have already become unattractive because their climate risk exposure has risen and their consumers are unwilling or unable to pay higher premiums. • Related to unaffordibility is a partly too low insurance market penetration, i. E. A too small percentage of policy holders in the total population of exposed households. For example, the market penetration in europe varies across different insurance systems in europe from up to 100% in the mandatory system in france to very low penetration rates of 10-25% in the voluntary private insurance system in austria. A flood insurance scheme with a market penetration of <25% is regarded as economically unviable.

Continued upgrading of protection infrastructures to maintain tolerable risk levels vis-a-vis climate change-induced increases in flood hazards requires constantly growing and accumulating public investments, can cause maladaptive path dependencies and growth in residual risk exposure, and thus vulnerability lock-ins. At the same time, the protective effects are always limited to defined design events (e. G. A 100-year annual probability of flood ocurrence), even when the same (e. G. 100-year) protection level is maintained through regular retrofitting. Due to excessive cost and/or future changes in extreme events, situations may occur where upgrading of protection structures reaches technical and/or economic limits, risk levels become intolerable, and substantial damage and loss inevitable in the long run. In such cases, managed retreat or relocation from exposed areas becomes the risk management option with a significantly more favourable cost-benefit ratio, compared to incremental retrofitting of protection infastructures, which offer short-term benefits, but may cause long-term lock-ins in exposure and risk, resulting in unexpectedly high damage when protection limits are reached.",0,Prevention: structural,structural,policy design & planning,"floods: riverine, fluvial",national & subnational
