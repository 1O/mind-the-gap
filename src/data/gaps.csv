1,"Knowledge, research & evidence","Lacking or insufficient data, information and evidence (e.g. related to climate, hazards, risk, management options) prevents more effective risk management policies and actions; uncertainties; monitoring systems and forecasting tools missing or not fit-for-purpose; complexity of climate-hazard-impact-event-management interactions and of compound and cascading risks"
2,Awareness & recognition,"Issues and (emerging) challenges not recognized or not perceived as urgent enough; problems and solutions have not entered policy agendas yet or have too little priority; lack of political will to act; available knowledge about key risks and management options not known or not accessible to decision-makers; lacking familiarity with existing plans, rules and procedures"
3,Policy-making & institutional,"Policies (strategies, plans, instruments, procedures) for new, emerging or extreme risks missing; critical issues are blind spots in existing policy frameworks or are not sufficiently addressed by policies; existing policies not fit-for-purpose, i.e. clear objectives and actions to manage key risks missing, lacking or incomplete; institutional arrangements and governance mechanisms missing or inadequateÂ "
4,Legislative & regulatory,"Absence or lack of updating of necessary legislation and regulatory provisions (incl. ordinances, norms, standards) to address critical issues or emerging challenges; existing regulations acting as barrier to solutions"
5,Implementation & capacity,"Policies and actions exist largely on paper only, implementation widely lacking or insufficient; lack of capacities (expertise, skills, training, infrastructure, technology, coordination capacity) among responsible institutions and actors to implement action; lacking availability of solutions (tools, instruments, measures)"
6,Compliance & enforcement,"Existing regulations, plans and procedures not applied or followed; insufficient inspection and enforcement of legal or policy provisions"
7,Effectiveness & efficiency,"Measures in place are lacking effectiveness and efficiency in coping with key risks (e.g. due to insufficient consideration of extreme events, cascading risks or residual risk, poor implementation, technical or human failure, missing cost-benefit or cost-effectiveness evaluations)"
8,Financing & resources,Lack of funding and financial resources; lack of staffing; lack of equipment
9,Policy coverage & design,"Certain issues or aspects of problems (e.g., emerging risks, cascading risks, compound impacts) not addressed by existing policies; restricted or disparate coverage of geograpic areas by policies (e.g., when policies do not apply to the entire territory of interest); certain vulnerable social groups or exposed system elements not covered; too rigid and unflexible policies that do not allow adapting to changing circumstances; lack of coherence and integration between different policy fields, leading to conflicting goals and trade-offs; lack of future-oriented foresight in policies, e.g. no preparedness for future climate change or changes in non-climatic risk drivers"
10,Local risk preparedness & community-driven adaptive capacities,"Low local preparedness levels; local prevention and coping capacities not fully exploited; lack of bottom-up or bottom-linked initiatives for review and improvement of risk management practices; disaster events not used as windows of opportunities for reflection and learning (e.g., systematic debriefings and structured event documentation lacking; lessons learnt missed or not implemented in practice); endogenous potentials for increasing resilience underused"
