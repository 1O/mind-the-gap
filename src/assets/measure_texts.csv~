sp_1,"Ongoing urbanisation continues to drive excessive land take and dispersed settlement patterns in many alpine regions, thereby continously increasing societal vulnerability and exposure of settlements, infrastructure and humans to floods and other natural hazards. The persistent growth dynamics of settlement areas vis-a-vis intensifying hazard processes and expanding hazard zones due to climate change result in constantly growing climate risks. Substantial reduction of further land consumption, soil sealing and urban sprawl is needed to contain further increase in risk exposure, but so far spatial planning policies and instruments have been limited in effectiveness, due to lack of adequate regulations, enforceability or coherent implementation. Spatial planning systems (legislation, planning instruments, fiscal and subsidy policies, planning processes and practices at all levels) need to be re-directed towards forcing compact, inward-oriented, land-efficient and soil-saving settlement development with adequate (re-)densification of built-up areas („land sufficiency“), while steering current and future hazard zones free from development and securing green spaces and their nature-based hazard protection and adaptation functions."
sp_2,"Goal-oriented, coordinated, enforcable, and consistently implemented portfolios of spatial planning measures and instruments (existing and new) for avoiding further land take and urban sprawl, e. g., : - Enhancement and more consistent and effective implementation of existing planning instruments to achieve established goals of sustainable spatial development; - binding and restrictive (national, subnational) quantitative goals for reduction of land take and soil sealing, concretized e. g., by allocation of maximum building land quota at regional level; - prioritizing goals related to soil-efficient use of land in spatial planning laws and in the weighing of interests in planning decisions; - concretizing restrictive criteria for the zoning of building land in spatial planning laws, and consistent implementation by strengthened regional planning with binding effects for local planning; - containment of outward-oriented settlement development and stronger protection of green spaces, e. g., by instruments such as settlement boundaries, priority green zones, and mandatory dedication of areas free of building development at municipal planning level; - obligations for compensating land take on formerly undeveloped land, e. g., by re-zoning building land reserves at other locations; - forcing the re-zoning of excessive building land reserves, especially in unfavourable, dispersed locations, at municipal planning level; - intensifying the management and re-use of brownfield sites and vacant buildings, including through inter-municipal cooperation, taxation, and subsidies."
sp_3,"Adjustment of financial instruments with steering effects on land use and soils:  - incentivicing soil-saving municipal policies by re-designing the fiscal transfer scheme between territorial authorities („Finanzausgleich“);  - readjusting soil-related fees and taxes to support economical, soil-efficient land use (e. g., Property tax, infrastructure development fees);  - introducing new fiscal policies with steering effects against urban sprawl and land consumption, e. g., fees for new zoning of building land (compensating for increase in property value), fees for secondary homes and building vacancies, soil sealing fees;  - re-designing subsidies to support soil-saving, e. g., by integrating financial incentives for retrofitting of buildings and brownfield recycling into housing construction subsidy schemes; staggering housing construction subsidies according to building densities, sealing degrees, and centrality of locations; funding for strengthening and revitalizing city centres."
sp_4,"Splintered settlement patterns with frayed outer boundaries are more difficult and more costly to protect against natural hazards and forest fires. In particular (future) risk of forest fires and wildfires are up to now hardly considered in settlement planning (local spatial development concept, zoning plan). Shaping compact settlements with clear outer boundaries is beneficial for cost-effective technical protection, and a less interlocked wildland-urban-interface reduces forest fire risk and facilitates forest fire control."
sp_5,"Lack of residual risk information for spatial planning and property owners: provision of technical basic information about areas exposed to residual risk (e. g., floods with 300‑year return intervals, or beyond) to spatial planning authorities, municipalities, planners and property owners; mandatory display and visualisation of residual risk information in spatial plans and maps, in particular at local level; public access to residual risk information to promote individual, private risk reduction measures."
sp_6,"Lacking or insufficient provisions related to residual risk areas in planning-related legislation: integration of residual risk in planning laws and building regulations, by anchoring residual risk areas plus associated restrictions for zoning of building land and for construction of buildings in legislation."
sp_7,"Introducing risk-differentiated, staggered restrictions for zoning of building land and building permits in residual risk areas, including zoning prohibitions for hazard-sensitive and intense land uses with substantial damage potential."
sp_8,"Maladaptive practice of suspending hazard maps and their restrictive effects on zoning of building land after protection structures have been implemented, leading to exponential growth of residual risk exposure due to settlement development in „former“ hazard zones and causing unexpectedly high damage and loss in cases of overload or failure („building land revision dilemma“, „protection-building-spiral“, ex-post maladaptation): hazard zone maps and building prohibitions for formerly red hazard zones need to be maintained to avoid irreversible vulnerability lock-ins and inevitably high damage and loss when technical protection limits are exceeded."
sp_9,"Developing and implementing legal requirements for flood-/hazard-proof building design in residual risk zones (building development plan, building law)."
sp_10,"Moving from hazard-oriented to risk-based spatial planning. Strengthening risk-based approaches in spatial planning requires that i) spatially relevant risk assessments are provided as technical information basis for planning, and ii) that, beyond hazard exposure, different degrees of vulnerability of planned and existing land uses are considered in planning decisions."
sp_11,Adoption of risk reduction and climate change adaptation as goals in spatial planning laws; defining risk as a planning principle in regulations.
sp_12,"Defining risk-based and risk-differentiated protection goals and safety levels in spatial planning for different forms of land use, according to their different damage potentials, vulnerabilities and exposure to hazards."
sp_13,"Developing and applying risk-oriented criteria for zoning decisions and building design (zoning plan, building development plan), e. g., based on risk zones, to allow steering of land use intensities according to damage potential, vulnerability and exposure."
sp_14,"Trying to keep overlapping areas of hazard zones and settlements as low as possible is an established guiding principle of spatial planning. However, past planning decisions, the absence of hazard maps in the past, and changing frequencies and magnitudes of hazard events have created situations where considerable amounts of zoned building land, existing buildings and infrastructure are located in areas exposed to risk. Due to climate-driven expansion of many hazard zones, the volume of exposed building land and objects is bound to grow further. The options for spatial planning to intervene with adaptation and risk reduction measures in already existing zonings and building structures are limited, because it would affect valid rights of property owners and property values. Provisions for dealing in a preventive way with risk-exposed stocks of buildings and zoned, but yet undeveloped building land are still largely missing. There is a need for addressing this gap in spatial planning legislation and instruments, in particular as regards building laws, and for providing guidelines for how to mitigate risks to existing settlement areas."
sp_15,"Clear zoning regulations that allow re-zoning of building land in hazard zones and residual risk zones, e. g., by: i) re-dimensioning excessive building land reserves in the course of cyclical revisions of zoning plans; ii) stipulating time limits for realisation of designated building uses in planning laws or by means of contractual spatial planning (with automatic re-zoning if time limits are exceeded); iii) applying „soft“ forms of re-zoning, such as temporal building bans or downgrading of building land reserves to future development areas, in order to ensure that property-related technical protection measures are taken before designated uses are realized."
sp_16,"Strengthening exploitation of risk reduction potentials of building laws and building development plans: i) provisions for land use restrictions on risk-exposed building land; ii) *ex-ante* and *ex-post* requirements for hazard-proof building design and object-related protection measures; iii) requirements for organisational preparedness measures at object/household level (e. g., statutory contingency concepts, alarm plans)."
sp_17,"Supportive, active role of spatial planning in managing retreat and resettlement (in high-risk areas with returning damage events and limited feasibility of technical protection) and for relocation of high-risk uses and critical infrastructure."
sp_18,"Giving preference to passive risk prevention and nature-based solutions for reduction of risks from floods, natural hazards and drought, whereever posssible. Avoiding settlement development in—current and future—hazard zones is the most effective and macroeconomically most cost-efficient strategy for risk reduction and climate adaptation. Simultaneously, by steering green and open spaces clear of development, their nature-based adaptation services against natural hazards and drought can be conserved and valorized, including water retention, rainwater infiltration, groundwater renewal, and decentralized rainwater management. Spatial planning needs a shift in perspective from planning the development of the built environment to „positive planning“ of green and open spaces on equal footing. This includes: giving more importance to the multiple functions and co-benefits of undeveloped green spaces for society and environment in the context of climate change; developing differentiated instruments for the planning and development of green spaces; upgrading the weight of nature- and landscape-related aspects in existing spatial planning instruments."
sp_19,"Establishing new functional planning categories for green and open spaces with climate adaptation and hazard protection functions, such as priority, precautionary, or reservation areas, and strengthening their designation and implementation in regional and local planning instruments. Defining clear rules and restrictions for zoning, building activities and land use in respectively designated areas and enforcing them in planning practices in order to safeguard the delivery of their nature-based protection and adaptation services."
sp_20,"Utilizing the potentials of local zoning plans, building development plans and building regulations to secure and activate space potentials for green and blue infrastructure on smaller scales within urban areas, including for rainwater and drought management (runoff, retention, infiltration, storage): legally based provisions for enabling and/or stipulating minimum shares of green, unsealed areas for rainwater retention and infiltration (at planning area level or building site level), maximum sealing percentages, requirements for desealing, areas for decentralized rainwater mangement, requirements for greening roofs, buildings and streets, et cetera."
sp_21,"In spatial planning decisions, public interests in the preservation of green spaces and their multifunctional co-benefits are regularly defeated by conflicting, more powerful economic use interests. Robust and traceable planning criteria for transparent assessment, weighing and prioritisation of green space functions for hazard prevention and climate adaptation are thus needed."
sp_22,"Designating natural flood runoff areas, flood retention areas, areas for controlled flooding in cases of emergency, and other areas with hazard-protective functions and keeping them clear of settlement development at all planning levels. This requires designating such areas as priority, precautionary or reservation zones in regional and inter-municipal plans, and defining clear, strict and legally binding restrictions for zoning, building, and other intense uses that might conflict with their runoff or retention functions at local planning level."
sp_23,Instruments and models for adapted land management in flood runoff and retention areas in order to safeguard fulfillment of their protective functions.
sp_24,"Restoration of floodplain ecosystems: utilizing mutual synergies in implementing measures for ecological river enhancement (water framework directive), nature restoration (restoration directive), and flood control (floods directive)."
sp_25,"Strengthening embedding of hazard maps / hazard zone plans in spatial planning laws and building regulations by defining binding and unambiguous legal effects on local spatial planning (consideration requirement): clear and restrictive rules for the zoning of building land, building permits, and requirements for hazard-proof constructions in designated hazard zones."
sp_26,"Strengthening implementation and enforcement of zoning and use restrictions connected to designated hazard zones, including through intensified checks of local plans by supervisory authorities at higher-ranking level."
sp_27,"Provision of basic technical information about pluvial flood risks (surface water maps, drainage areas, surface runoff pathways, hazard index maps, etc.), Especially considering climate change, for spatial planning. Addressing urban drainage and flooding in local climate adaptation plans. Giving public access to such hazard assessments to increase risk awareness and risk preparedness of municipalities, property owners, and citizens."
sp_28,"Pluvial flood hazards are still a regulatory gap in many planning laws: planning legislation should allow, or require, restrictions and conditionalities for the zoning of building land and the issuing of building permits in areas exposed to pluvial flood hazards."
sp_29,Storm water runoff infrastructure in urban areas is often inadequate to current and predicted rainfall intensities. Statutory requirements for adjusted design of buildings and object-related protection measures in areas exposed to surface runoff are needed and should be addressed by urban adaptation plans.
sp_30,"Intensifying application of measures for prevention of pluvial flood risk in local planning instruments: designation of free spaces for runoff pathways, areas for nature-based rainwater drainage and infiltration, water retention areas, drainage concepts as part of building development plans, etc. Securing in a timely way the urban spaces needed for implementation of such measures is crucial."
sp_31,"High degrees of sealed soils in urban areas cause a significant increase in risk of pluvial flooding (plus in heat stress) and reduce area potentials for natural drainage, infiltration and storage of rainwater. This calls for new regulations and measures to avoid new soil sealing and to promote de-sealing: i) provisions in building development plans for determining maximum sealing degrees, minimum shares of unsealed areas capable of rainwater infiltration, desealing potentials, sealing bans, or desealing commandments; ii) sealing fees or desealing rewards; iii) integrating incentives for desealing in subsidy schemes for housing, restoration and village renewal; iv) upper thresholds for sealed car parking spaces (residential homes, retail centres)."
sp_32,"Just as climate change impacts and hazards do not stop at administrative borders, many spatially relevant risk management and adaptation measures require space, i. e. Land resources, that cut across municipal boundaries or are located in territories of other municipalities, and measures sometimes can affect different municipalities in different ways. Inter-municipal cooperation is thus needed to secure joint areas for flood retention, nature-based hazard prevention, green infrastructure, groundwater renewal, and active structural protection measures. Often, burdens and benefits are distributed asymmetrically between neighbouring municipalities, e. g., when natural flood retention areas need to be preserved in upstream municipalities, whereas downstream municipalities benefit from higher protection levels and new development potentials, which requires inter-municipal negotiations and agreements."
sp_33,"Municipalities are often over-challenged with organising, institutionalising and financing inter-municipal cooperation for measures that affect the territories of two or more municipalities. Spatial planning authorities and higher governance levels should thus provide and strengthen supportive framework conditions for inter-municipal cooperation models. Higher-level support may relate to: i) developing and using cooperative planning instruments and processes for inter-municipal risk management and climate adaptation measures; ii) intensifying use of existing, formal and informal planning instruments to implement inter-municipal agreements, e. g., by designating and securing large-scale, border-crossing precautionary areas for flood and natural hazard protection in regional spatial plans; iii) legal and institutional strengthening of regional cooperation models; iv) providing financial incentives for inter-municipal cooperation; v) organisational support and counselling by higher-level authorities, e. g., by means of facilitating cross-municipal negotiations or providing model cooperation agreements; vi) employment of existing regional governance structures (e. g., Leader regions, regional managements, regional flood protection associations) to support and embed inter-municipal cooperation; vii) preparing good practice examples of inter-municipal cooperation models."
sp_34,"Need to develop and establish (financial) compensation models and mechanisms between municipalities for coping with asymmetric distribution of burdens and benefits of land provision for risk prevention in a solidary way (e. g., Upstream-downstream problem in flood risk management), e. g., by means of inter-municipal fiscal transfer."

sp_43,"Providing work aids, decision support tools, guidance, and good practice examples on how to deal with (extreme) climate risks to planners, planning authorities (esp. Municipalities), and supervisory and approval authorities (in charge of checking and approving spatial plans)."
sp_44,"Spatial planning, climate adaptation, natural hazard / flood risk management, and civil protection are all eminently cross-sectoral and multi-level disciplines, with often complex and fragmented division of competencies between different levels of government (depending on the political-administrative state system). Moreover, the management of extreme weather events and their often interacting consequences requires holistic perspectives and integrated approaches, with well-working cooperation of multiple stakeholders. Overcoming disciplinary policy silos and administrative fragmentation is thus a pressing need, increasing the importance of improving cooperation and coordination of spatial planning with sector policies and sectoral planning (horizontally) as well as between planning levels (vertically). This requires both, good government and good governance, i. e. Enforcable and institutionalised rules and mechanisms of coordination as well as strengthened and new informal governance arrangements."
sp_45,"Reinforcing involvement of regional and local actors, stakeholders and citizens by strengthening cooperative and participatory planning processes, giving particular attention to adequately involving vulnerable and marginalized groups. Participatory and inclusive planning contributes to solving conflicts related to land use and risk management, and it has significant potential to enhance legitimacy, quality, feasibility and acceptance of risk management solutions."
ff_1,"Dedicated strategic policies (strategies, action plans, programmes, or similar policy documents) for integrated forest fire management at national and/or subnational (Länder, cantons, provinces, etc.) Level integrated fire management policies should ideally consider: - diverse drivers of forest fires, especially climate change and socio-economic factors (e. g., Increased recreational activities, rural abandonment) - multiple impacts and risks caused by fire events (e. g., Loss of protective function, natural hazards, soil erosion, wildland-urban-interface)- forests and their adjacent landscapes and respective landuses - coherence (trade-offs, synergies) with other relevant policies (e. g., Biodiversity conservation, sustainable development, recreational usage of forests, etc. ) - Multiple stakeholders from other relevant fields of policy-making and society (e. g., Civil protection, climate adaptation, science, civil society) - measures along the complete cycle of forest fire management (prevention, pre-suppression, suppression, post-fire management, knowledge and learning)."

cp_4,Adequate use of preventive measures advocated by local institutions.
cp_5,"Onlookers often hinder emergency services, necessitating clear warnings and personal responsibility."
cp_6,"Issue of compliance: even though local population might know how they should behave, they sometimes do not follow the rules. Some people were warned about the event and its possible outcome, but still did not take the warning serious."
cp_7,Systematic and long-term strengthening of volunteer work and proactive engagement for prevention work is needed. This implies that legislative frameworks need to safeguard the availability of volunteers and increase the attractiveness of voluntary engagement in disaster relief.

cp_14,"A risk culture among local/regional actors (esp. Mayors) is missing, e. g., regarding the limits of technical protection measures. In some municipalities no official emergency or operational plans were made before the event."
cp_15,"Target-group specific information need to be provided, for example for citizens, mayors, tourists, planners, businesses and farmers. In some municipalities it was difficult for the citizens to find out the correct information during the response phase.

cp_16,"Climate proofing of local projects (e. g., construction, funding)."
cp_17,"Integration of different information is needed, for example hazard zone plans, hazard warning maps, and climate scenarios. In some cases, the hazard 'wind' was not considered in civil protection and contigency plans. Here, hazard maps and civil protection plans should contain the same scenarios. Therefore, civil protection plans need to be extended and increase their practical relevance by providing also feasible options for action (not only information about hazards and risks) for different scenarios. A contact center point or a strengthened regional information center would help to facilitate this process."
cp_18,"Enhanced municipal risk precaution with specialized offers, like a natural hazard risks precaution check (“vorsorgecheck naturgefahren im klimawandel”). This could help coordinating the implementation process of resilience strategies between municipalities."
cp_19,"Improved structural and organizational measures for municipal risk precaution, which should be deducted from hazard zone maps. This could help solving issues like the difficulty to find suiting technical instrumentation in the response phase and the lacking consideration of wind hazards in civil protection and contingency plans. The overall goal should, however, be to get out of the logic of documents with check boxes and bring the municipality crisis plan to life."
cp_20,Adequate use of preventive measures advocated by local institutions.
cp_21,"Providing model templates for municipal disaster prevention plans (e. g., in Austria provided by the regional centre for crisis and disaster management)."
cp_22,"Disaster prevention plans should include (inter alia): legal frameworks for civil protection organisation; checklists and flowcharts for risks (e. g., floods, blackouts); emergency contacts and communication protocols; public warning systems and press coordination; lists of emergency personnel, accommodation resources, and evacuation plans; inventories of critical buildings, support operations, and protective structures; alarm plans and sample forms."

Too broad-meshed measuring network limits detection and prediction accuracy of small-scale extreme events, such as extreme hail, torrential rain, peak discharges, smaller torrents, location of thunderstorms, and strong winds. Additional measuring stations, including further small analogous hydrological measuring stations, are needed. Increased use of remote sensing methods (radar measurements, satellite data, aerial surveys, terrestrial photography) can help to densify the measuring network.

nh_16,Unbalanced allocation of resources. More investment in measures of early stages of the risk management cycle saves recovery costs.
nh_17,"Need for reforms of risk transfer mechanisms, particularly with regard to private properties. Missing mandatory building insurance is a key driver of economic vulnerability. For instance, in Austria, damages caused by natural hazards such as flooding or debris flows are only partially covered by insurance, and relevant information is usually not available. Compulsory, uniform flood and natural hazard insurance models (as in Switzerland) that are rooted in solidarity principles, i. e. mandatory insurance of the respective owners against natural hazards, has potential to overcome constraints of private voluntary insurance systems and maladaptive, pervert incentives of public disaster relief funds models. Together with short-term liquidity options like kontokorrent loans, this could reduce financial vulnerability. Compulsory insurance also can have supportive effects in the context of increased personal precautions."
nh_18,"Aspects of financial risk management often overwhelm municipal authorities, with fragmented processes for (insuring, recovering and compensating) private and public damage. A centralised unit to manage funding and (reconstruction of) settlements could provide structural support."
nh_19,"Insurance systems, in particular such based on the private insurance market, are increasingly under pressure due to rising flood risk. According to projections, several european regions could face an adaptation tipping point in the long run beyond which the uptake of flood insurance will be too low for a viable system. Limits to the viability of (market-based) insurance systems can result from constraints to premium ratings and from constraints on maximizing coverage: - due to climate change and the urbanization of floodplains, insurers are already experiencing or anticipating increasing risk and will be forced to raise their premium ratings. Higher premiums may cause increased unaffordability for low-income groups and an overall decreased demand, decreasing the financial viability of insurance programs. For some insurers, market conditions have already become unattractive because their climate risk exposure has risen and their consumers are unwilling or unable to pay higher premiums. - Related to unaffordibility is a partly too low insurance market penetration, i. e. a too small percentage of policy holders in the total population of exposed households. For example, the market penetration in europe varies across different insurance systems in europe from up to 100% in the mandatory system in france to very low penetration rates of 10-25% in the voluntary private insurance system in Austria. A flood insurance scheme with a market penetration of <25% is regarded as economically unviable. Overcoming these constraints may require that governments step in by introducing forms of public insurance or ad hoc publicly funded compensation programmes."
nh_20,"Public-private insurance schemes with incentives for flood mitigation and the government acting as a re-insurer to cover extreme losses is a potentially viable option to anticipate future challenges. However, the state may also seek to protect itself from expanding flood risk liabilities."
nh_21,"Large-scale disaster losses can have severe macroeconomic consequences that limit governmental compensation and recovery capacities. This can lead to declining government debt ratings and overstrain lending and compensation capacities, which can happen through the following mechanisms: direct post-disaster costs due to compensation payments and repair of damaged public infrastructure; deterioriation of economic conditions and contraction of GDP; lower public tax incomes; downgrading of the government debt rating by agencies, resulting in rising interest rates for the government, higher public borrowing costs, and reduced ability to repay future debts. Research shows that higher historical disaster losses as a percentage of gdp are associated with lower public debt ratings. Moreover, government compensation may be reduced or delayed following severe, compound or repeated flood events, which hampers recovery in affected areas, thus further reducing GDP."
nh_22,"Any kind of disaster insurance can inhibit behaviourial changes and individual, proactive risk precaution measures of the insurance holders. In particular private household insurances, which (e. g., in Austria) often cover damages only to a very limited extent, can create unrealistically high trust and false feelings of security, undermining the willingness of property owners to take individual adaptation measures and thus creating maladaptive outcomes. Through closer cooperation with the insurance industry, insurance premiums and deductibles can be better aligned with individual risk and protection levels in order to incentivize private protection measures (e. g., by offering premium discounts for risk reduction measures). Insurance-led climate resilience education programs can play a role in raising awareness for the limitations of insurance."
nh_23,"Development and establishment of certification systems regarding the status/level of protection of buildings (analog to energy certificates), in cooperation with the insurance industry, and making such protection certification mandatory for purchase and sale of properties."
nh_24,"Public disaster relief funds cause potentially maladaptive effects and counterproductive incentives with regard to individual risk precaution measures, because private households can feel less motivated to take individual proactive risk reduction measures or to tackle residual risks, relying on public damage compensation, and thus sustaining risk exposure. In addition, individual vulnerabilities and risks of those immediately exposed are shifted to governments, i. e. the collective of taxpayers, which can be seen as a form of maladaptation by stimulating free-riding behaviour, re-distributing the costs of individual inaction to others. by coupling the amount of public damage compensation payments to the level of individual risk precaution measures (private protection measures at buildings and properties), precautionary behaviour can be rewarded and incentivized."

Among other reasons, this is also important for better process understanding and for improving prevention and protection measures."
nh_29,"Standardized loss documentation: need for documentation not only of natural hazard events, but also of the concrete damages and losses they caused on concrete objects in order to besser assess their vulnerability.

nh_36,"Projections of flood changes are challenging based on current knowledge because future trends in climate extremes, particularly precipitation, cannot be calculated with sufficient reliability and remain inherently uncertain. As future climatic changes are likely to alter historic statistical correlations, currently designated flood zones and the protection levels of flood-proofed buildings will become outdated. Even current estimates of protection levels are uncertain, because historic data series are limited, which hampers extrapolation to the extreme values needed for defining maximum water levels and their protection standard."

nh_40,"Need for improved climate scenarios, improved process understanding and model simulations of precipitation change in alpine mountain regions: climate model scenarios for the alpine area are still subject to high uncertainties, in particular for precipitation. Climate services of the same quality for people living in mountain regions as for the rest of Austria must drive forward regional climate modelling for the alpine region in particular."
nh_41,"Improved and denser monitoring network for hazard triggers and hazard processes, in particular:
- monitoring of runoff and sediment dynamics of alpine rivers needs to be further enhanced, specifically in torrent catchments that have not been monitored to date and pose a substantial hazard potential and risk to the built environment (this includes also monitoring of soil properties, e. g., Water storage capacity and carbon stock);
- monitoring of hazardous conditions in tourist areas (e. g., hiking trails) could be used to better inform tourism stakeholders and tourists about potential risks; 
- monitoring of natural forest disturbances (wind, fire, pests) can support adaptation measures;  
- monitoring of permafrost and erosion and their short- and long-term effects are also important for the assessment of changing risks for infrastructure in high alpine terrain (huts, alpine routes, ski lifts);

nh_44,"Like any policy or measure, structural natural hazard protection measures can have unintended negative consequences, which might even backfire on protection, climate resilience and risk reduction goals. Such unintended outcomes are often referred to as maladaptation, defined by the IPCC (2022) as „actions that may lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes, including via increased GHG emissions, increased or shifted vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or diminished welfare, now or in the future“. Preventing and minimizing maladaptive outcomes requires efforts to identify, track and steer trade-offs, conflicts and detrimental side effects of protection measures early on and throughout the life-cycle of a measure. However, operational methodologies and procedures for *ex-ante* assessment and monitoring of maladaptation risks as well as guidance on how to prevent and limit maladaptive outcomes are still largely lacking."

nh_46,"Need for more systematic post-event analysis, debriefing and learning: making better use of disaster events as a window of opportunity to increase resilience and to overcome outdated risk management approaches. This requires: i) more structured event documentation and improved post-event analysis; ii) more systematic debriefing processes after events; iii) with inclusion of various stakeholders and reflections involving all parties; iv) integration of learnings and new knowledge into existing tools for monitoring, predictions, nowcasting, and new approaches to prevention; v) operational and lessons-learned protocols to guide future responses."

These should evolve within governance processes which then can be transferred to areas with similar challenges. This may imply getting away from the logic of documents with check boxes and bringing the municipality crisis plan to life."
nh_59,"Using risk scenarios, which were ideally already developed in the risk assessment process, to represent various possible future development pathways and support decision making with respect to protection goals."
nh_60,"The concept of risk as a dynamic parameter is difficult to include in planning decisions, because: a) planning regulations use hazard zones as essential basis for landuse planning and aim to accomplish and guarantee a certain level of safety. B) the planning mechanisms are rather formal and allow certain participation but have no basic governance aspect/perspective. Potential improvements: i) integrate planning institutions and planners widely in discussions of holistic prevention. Ii) establish governance-based discussions already on a regional and strategically orientated level."

nh_63,"Public administration needs to respect peoples’ opinions and be sensitive to emerging local or regional initiatives. Public administration should aim to give people the possibility to participate, consider individual experiences, motivations and personal abilities to take action. Communication between local actors (e. g., firefighters and municipality) and the provincial offices should be improved."
nh_64,"Risk governance is not an independent state-owned instrument: the development to integrate risk governance mechanisms in the way society handles and manages natural hazards demands innovations and adaptations in the existing management systems. A standardised and universal scheme is not applicable because risk cultures and institutional embedding differ. Integration of risk governance in existing ways of managing hazards would mean certain administrative reorganisation and establish a dialogue among peers accompanied by experts. Cross-sectoral cooperation is often insufficient and needs to be improved, especially at the national level."

nh_66,"An opening of the strict procedures in planning and implementation of structural measures for hazard prevention is needed. A) by involving local people on a local to regional level in the discussion of long-term strategic concepts to establish holistic concepts for raising resilience and risk reduction. B) by adapting the institutional framework (e. g., long-term financing, educational programmes) accordingly."
nh_67,"Improving scalability of resource management and logistics (personnel, machinery, financial means) for the response phase: need for planning of response capacities for large-scale events that need supraregional responses and coordination."
nh_68,"Social vulnerability reduces adaptive capacity, and adaptation gaps are often attributed to processes underlying social vulnerability. Generally, individuals with lower levels of education, lower income and poorer health as well as areas with a substantial elderly population tend to have lower capacity for adaptation and to experience higher mortality rates during flood events. Compared with homeowners, renters have faced higher rates of displacement, ineligibility for post-disaster assistance and reductions in the stock of affordable housing. In cases of managed retreat (relocation) from exposed areas, socially vulnerable residents may lack coping capacity, being unable to migrate and remaining trapped in the area. At the same time, vulnerable groups are often not included in risk governance processes. Thus, specific challenges and needs of vulnerable groups must be actively taken into account in safety planning and risk prevention and through their inclusion in decision-making processes. Policy measures targeted at reducing social vulnerabilities and improving socio-economic factors, including income, education level and health, need to be considered alongside improvements in disaster risk management."

Establishment of a contact center point to manage and steer stakeholder involvement.
nh_70,"Managed retreat from heavily exposed risk areas, as a transformative adaptation option, requires strategic planning and coordination as well as intense involvement of affected stakeholders, which needs to be facilitated by governments. Even if the retreat is ultimately not realized, the discussion about it offers an opportunity for reassessing a community’s readiness to adapt to high and growing risk."
nh_71,"Developing an alpine risk management plan to deal with cross-border risks in a coordinated approach. As natural hazards do not stop at regional or national borders, an alpine-wide common framework to deal with large-scale and potential cross-border impacts is required. The focus is on natural hazards that have the potential to lead to large-scale and cross-border impacts, such as large-scale flood events with impacts on whole river basins and protective forests, affecting both settlements as well as critical infrastructures in the alps. A common alpine-wide framework for risk management of cross-border risks is needed that takes into account existing risk management systems and their approaches. The following steps need to be considered:  - definition of common steps/cycle of risk management;  - definition of common methods and standards for risk mapping and monitoring, based on existing national legal framework conditions;  - delimitation of risks that should be considered in the common framework (local vs. Cross-border impacts);  - recommendations and toolbox on risk prevention measures for cross-border risks (e. g., regarding harmonization of early warning systems, regarding construction stops in flood-prone areas) and experiences;  - definition of specific measures to deal with hazard “hot-spots” for critical infrastructures and settlements;  - recommendations for practitioners (could also include training/exchange)."
nh_72,"Alpine-wide capacity-building, support and knowledge transfer to support individual risk precaution against natural and climate-driven hazards in a transnational approach. To strengthen the role of civil society within the risk governance framework, supplementing public risk management by public authorities, the following steps have potential to trigger considerable activities through streamlining and making use of effects of scale:  - compiling a comprehensive toolbox for private adaptation and invidivual risk precaution, building on available materials and experiences in alpine countries (e. g., tools to assess risk at household level; tools to explore adaptation options for households and property owners; teaching and information materials);  - setting up an operational network of regional adaptation coordinators in all regions of the alpine area to increase capacities of local decision makers and the civil society, ensure effective knowledge transfer, and support and coordinate specific implementation measures;  - implementing an alpine-wide capacity-building and qualification programme for teachers, educators, education institutions,etc. ;  - Incentivizing individual risk precaution measures (e. g., flood-protection measures for buildings)."

It is key to ensure that 1) knowledge co-production sustains through time; (2) relevant actors participate; (3) knowledge needs of policy actors are considered properly; (4) diﬀerent disciplinary approaches are considered; (5) knowledge resulting from co-production processes are (latter) used in the policy process; and (6) there is enough time and resources for proper coordination to develop co-production processes."

High levels of adaptive capacity that do not necessarily translate into household adaptation action, by establishing collaborations between households and municipalities (e. g., via contact center points)."
nh_75,"Improving the involvement of actors in residual risk management. Stakeholders involved in technical risk management services (i. e. Flood prevention services, road and infrastructure services) as well as elected officials in other relevant positions must be able to participate in decision-making processes in order to be able to have an influence at the administrative level.

This includes involvement in selection of protection measures, contingency and emergency planning, and in the recovery phase. Stakeholder involvement increases risk awareness, knowledge and acceptance of measures, as well as compliance with warnings and civil protection plans. Local contact center points can help overcoming inadequate use of preventive measures advocated by local institutions and insufficient responses of citizens to warnings."

nh_94,"Mapping hazard hot-spots for critical infrastructure and settlements with cross-border relevance in a transnational approach: transport, energy and communication infrastructures build the backbone of the economy, especially for the alps as crossroads for the european market and as important element of the european energy system. Also, health infrastructures have a cross-border function in the alps. Specific risks/hot-spots for these critical infrastructures need to be identified in a common approach to develop coordinated adaptation solutions. Furthermore, hot-spots for action can arise in settlement areas, which are affected by cross-border natural risks. Such hot-spots need to be identified in order to develop coordinated approaches for risk management. Permanent monitoring of hazard hot-spots allows early warning and re-adjustment of risk prevention and management measures."
nh_95,"Hazard zone maps (e. g., in Austria) are a proven, widely accepted planning tool, but introducing new instruments, such as risk planning, faces resistance due to potential socio-economic impacts and conflicts of interest."

nh_97,"When planning recovery measures, the entire catchment area should be considered (e. g., to avoid lock-ins or transfer of risk to other places)."
nh_98,"The guidelines for hazard maps do currently not require consideration of complex scenarios. A multi-hazard, multi-risk and multi-vulnerability approach is required for the management of natural hazards triggered by changes in temperature and precipitation. Methods and tools considering cascading effects and interactions between hazards in mountain areas are limited. Strategies, guidelines and management practices for dealing with multi-hazard and multi-risk scenarios as well as for compound / cascading risk management are needed."

nh_100,Political resistance against changing flood zone delineations and against obligatory retrofitting of existing buildings in flood zones can be a severe constraint for reducing risk exposure.
nh_101,Assessments that explicitly address the extent of residual risk that remains after the implementation of protection measures are missing.
nh_102,"Hazard zone maps (as in Austria) focus on hazards, (only) partially considering risks based on potential damages. Need for expanding traditional hazard-focused assessment towards integrated risk evaluation, which recognizes exposure and vulnerability as equally important risk components and support the development of respective tools."
nh_103,"Hazard maps and risk assessments need to be readjusted and updated more frequently in order to mirror the pace of climate change.

nh_106,"Developing tools for assessing multiple as well as cascading risks and consider them in the risk assessment as the combination of events may lead to unforeseeable consequences. Guidelines for hazard maps and risk management do currently not consider complex scenarios and management of compound or cascading risks. For example, additional, cascading risk scenarios like channel blockage or reservoir spillover are currently not considered in hazard assessment and mapping (e. g., channel blockage, reservoir spillover). While modules incorporating risk scenarios could aid decision-makers, uncertainty complicates practical use."

Hazard maps for 10-, 100-, and 500-year floods exist e. g., for the Sora catchment (Slovenia), but climate change impacts are not included yet. Standard hazard assessments in place (return period) do not address risk nor impacts of climate change; they are static and focus on the status quo of spatial development, not accounting for changes in climate or land use.

When talking about residual risk, clear messages, precise information and concrete guidance/actions must be used. The terms 'residual risk' and 'case of overload' should be communicated with care, as they are sensitive topics. Communicating uncertainties is important, but challenging."

nh_135,Specific warning and alert systems or emergency plans to accompany protective structures and thus prevent cases of failure due to overload.
nh_136,"Lack of risk-related management practices dealing with exceeding of design event of existing mitigation measures. Thus, take into account the possible failure of a protection measure and prepare for the case of overload. Learn from past situations where existing structural measures did not protect from the scenario that enfolded. Ensure that the communities in risk-prone zones are prepared and reduce potential damage by building up a certain level of redundancy in protection measures, where possible. Technical good practices need to include constructions that were designed with special consideration of cases of overload. This may require overcoming barriers (legal situation, narrow / short-term cost considerations) to consideration of extreme scenarios and overload scenarios in the planning and reconstruction phase."
nh_137,Insufficient river management and land use management: non-emptying open check dams;  regulated/narrowed stream channels;  inadequate storm water runoff infrastructure.
nh_138,"Managed retreat and relocation should be considered as an alternative risk management option in situations where path dependencies could lead to lock-in effects, especially in high-risk areas with returning damage events, limited feasibility of technical protection, and/or high probability that technical protection limits may be reached under conditions of progressing climate change. Continued upgrading of protection infrastructures to maintain tolerable risk levels vis-a-vis climate change-induced increases in flood hazards requires constantly growing and accumulating public investments, can cause maladaptive path dependencies and growth in residual risk exposure, and thus vulnerability lock-ins. At the same time, the protective effects are always limited to defined design events (e. g., a 100-year annual probability of flood ocurrence), even when the same (e. g., 100-year) protection level is maintained through regular retrofitting. Due to excessive cost and/or future changes in extreme events, situations may occur where upgrading of protection structures reaches technical and/or economic limits, risk levels become intolerable, and substantial damage and loss inevitable in the long run. In such cases, managed retreat or relocation from exposed areas becomes the risk management option with a significantly more favourable cost-benefit ratio, compared to incremental retrofitting of protection infastructures, which offer short-term benefits, but may cause long-term lock-ins in exposure and risk, resulting in unexpectedly high damage when protection limits are reached."
nh_139,"Lack of approaches to cope with the non-stationarity of return periods and increasing uncertainties with regard to extreme events, leading to outdating of protection levels. Need for evaluating and adjusting design events for protection systems and protection goals for exposed assets (e. g., via different levels of protection for different land use intensities) and for adapting existing protection infrastructures to new challenges, e. g., by harnessing methods such as monte carlo analyses, regionalization and bootstrapping methods to overcome issues related to limited historic data and (future) uncertainty."
nh_140,"Increasing protection goals and extending, retrofitting or upgrading protection structures, e. g., by: setting higher protection standards (design events), general safety margins, buffer surcharges, or tailored solutions for specific local contexts (instead of standardized, countrywide approaches), harnessing engineering potential for upgrading structural protection measures. Linear maintenance of flood control structures built between 1950 and 1970, which are nearing the end of their design lifespan, can cause 'technical floods'. These structures were based on past return periods and event intensities, which may no longer be accurate."
nh_141,"Lack of routines and resources to ensure maintenance and performance of structural protection measures and watercourses can create significant risk management gaps. Development and implementation of plans, standard operating procedures, and adequate capacities (e. g., budget, personnel) are essential for regular inspections, maintenance, and performance checks of structural measures. These efforts should aim to sustain continuous functionality and effectiveness. Staggered maintenance may be an adaptive and adequate approach to coping with risk situations that are changing dynamically. Authorization procedures to intervene with machinery in the beds of blocked watercourses can take very long and thus be a barrier to timely maintenance."
nh_142,"Harness nature-based solutions, including natural floodplains, as an alternative to engineered flood control and protection due to their lower cost, ecological benefits and ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions."
nh_143,"Technical protection measures should be designed in a way that allows a controllable and ‘smooth’ overloading without causing major damages (e. g., controlled flooding, check dams). Technical good practices need to include constructions that were designed with special consideration of cases of overload. Sudden failure of protection measures potentially leading to uncontrollable consequences must be avoided. Steering a hazard’s impacting forces into areas of little damage potential is of crucial importance and technically feasible in many cases."
nh_144,"Design standards of protection structures, and related investments, that are optimal from an economic cost-benefit perspective may change in the future owing to the changing level of hazard induced by climate change. Optimizing future design standards requires integrating changes in climate-induced hazard levels into cost-benefit analyses for structural protection measures, in order to ensure their cost-effectiveness, resilience, and sustainability. In that regard, narrow, short-term cost considerations can be a barrier to consideration of extreme and overload scenarios, both in the planning and reconstruction phase."
nh_145,"The impact of climate change on the functionality and durability of technical structures protecting against natural hazards is mostly still a knowledge gap. There is a lack of approaches to manage increases in risk in cases where flood mitigation measures are destroyed by events. This necessitates, despite limited historical data and future uncertainties, evaluating and enhancing the reliability of protection infrastructures to address expected climate trends."
nh_146,"Lack of structural protection measures against specific hazards. In particular, protection structures for wind and wind-related risks are missing, not sufficiently effective or difficult to construct."
nh_147,"Challenge of how to protect against unexpected scenarios, such as superposed flood waves and other cascading effects."
nh_148,"Structural protection measures have requirements in terms of surface areas. If privately owned land is needed for construction of protection infrastructure, this can cause conflicts with private landowners and decrease acceptance of the population."
nh_149,"Temporary protective measures, such as mobile protection structures, require reliable early warnings, often with short lead times."
nh_150,"Structural protection measures may shift vulnerability and risk to other places and other people. Such maladaptive effects can occur especially if one-sided localized approaches to the planning of protection systems prevail. For example, structural river engineering can accelerate and amplify flood waves and increase flood risk in downstream river sections. Similarly, object-related protection measures against flooding and heavy rainfall, e. g., by geoengineering terrain features or through technical safety constructions on properties, can increase vulnerability to flooding of neighboring properties at local scale or, through summation effects, of entire drainage areas and downstream residents. Planning protection systems at regional scale, rather than focusing on individual structures at local scale, is more likely to avoid unintended re-distribution of vulnerability and risk to other places. Applying ex-ante assessments of unintended side effects and setting up cross-sectoral, multi-level coordination mechanisms for protective measures can be helpful in that regard."
nh_151,"Structural protection measures, such as river regulations, artificial water retention reservoirs or torrential control measures, often involve trade-offs and potential conflicts with environmental sustainability and may cause negative external effects on ecosystems, natural resources, and biodiversity. Examples include degradations of river and floodplain ecosystems and of their ecosystem services, including for nature-based adaptation and risk reduction functions. Giving preference to alternative risk management options, such as nature-based solutions (e. g., securing and restoring natural flood retention and runoff areas) or non-structural prevention measures (e. g., preventive spatial planning aimed at containing risk exposure), whereever possible, can prevent such maladaptive outcomes."
nh_152,"Structural protection measures may involve trade-offs and conflicts with goals of social justice and equity, e. g., by creating unequitable social distribution effects. Driven by cost-benefit considerations, investments in flood adaptation to sustain tolerable risk are most common in densely populated, urbanised and economically well-developed areas with substantial assets. The high cost of flood protection and other technical adaptation options (e. g., elevating buildings) often forestalls action in sparsely populated regions, with rural and economically disadvantaged areas typically exhibiting lower levels of structural adaptation. If adaptation investments in wealthy communities are prioritised, while poorer and vulnerable communities are left without comparable levels of flood protection, this tends to entrench existing social and spatial inequalities and raises questions about the fairness of public resource allocation."
nh_153,"The presence of technical protection measures can trigger and sustain unrealistically high trust in public flood protection measures, especially if combined with lack of awareness about residual risk and reliance on social support in disaster situations. This can create false feelings of security, foster problem-avoiding behaviour and undermine the willingness of private actors (households, property owners) to take individual risk precaution measures. In part, investing heavily in protection infrastructure can inhibit autonomous adaptation action, increase dependency on public risk reduction measures, and create perverse incentives for people to settle in areas that are only temporarily safe (e. g., flood embankments) or to remain in places and continue with activities that make them vulnerable in the case of a residual risk event happening. Counteracting these unintended effects requires clear communication of protection standards, safety levels, residual risk, and the limited effects of protection systems, in order to foster risk awareness, incentivise individual risk precaution measures and improve compliance with public risk reduction measures."
nh_154,"Through interaction with spatial development, flood and natural hazard protection infrastructures can induce maladaptive development trajectories that are difficult or impossible to reverse, correct or retract. Implementation of protection measures often incentivizes 'business-as-usual' development and can trigger development intensification with new construction activities, expansion of settlement areas and in-migration of residents on supposedly ‘protected’ land. In conjunction with increasing flood hazards due to climate change, this consisteantly increases exposure to (growing) residual risk, vulnerability, and severity of consequences in case of overload or technical failure (‘safe development paradox’). Especially when climate-related risks increase at a faster rate than upgrades to existing protective infrastructure, this can result in excessive damage and loss when adaptation limits are exceeded. The reliance on structural protection measures with their associated high, returning and accumulating costs can create path dependencies with self-reinforcing dynamics, by tieing up capital and by shaping the legal, administrative and mental framework conditions, thus reducing the solution space over time."

pf_45,"The complete clearing of contiguous areas often has unfavourable effects on the protective function; possible trade-offs between protection against natural hazards and measures for bark beetle management need to be balanced.
